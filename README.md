# Motion Detection Using Python

This project is a basic implementation of a motion detection system using Python and OpenCV. It captures real-time video input from a webcam or a video file, detects motion by comparing frames, and highlights regions where movement is detected.

## Features

- Real-time motion detection
- Highlights motion areas with bounding boxes
- Timestamped logging of motion events
- Easy to customize and extend

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with email or messaging APIs for real-time alerts
- Save clips of motion events
- Adjustable sensitivity settings
